## ✅ Solution Delivered

### **1. Individual Requirement Comments**
**When a comment is on a specific requirement → Show ONLY for that requirement**

```
[#13] Charging tablets in coater using split butterfly valve through 
      auto charging method which shall be similar to existing design.

   💬 REQUIREMENT COMMENT:
      Author: Khatib, Mohammed
      Date: 2025-09-03T15:22:00Z
      
      📝 Glatt will be offering closed charging of the tablets into 
          the coater machine with the help of integrated closed 
          butterfly valve
```

✅ **This comment appears ONLY with requirement #13**

---

### **2. Section-Level Comments**
**When a comment is on a section header → Show for ALL requirements in that section**

```
====================================================================
📂 SECTION 5.4: COATING EQUIPMENT
====================================================================

🔖 SECTION-LEVEL COMMENT (applies to ALL requirements below):
   Author: QA Manager
   Date: 2025-09-03
   
   📝 All coating equipment must comply with ATEX Zone 2 requirements
       for solvent-based processes. Equipment must be explosion-proof.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[5.4.1] Coating drum should have 250L capacity

[5.4.2] Drum should have viewing ports for inspection

[5.4.3] Temperature control system required with ±2°C accuracy

[5.4.4] Inlet and exhaust air handling system
```

✅ **The section comment applies to ALL of 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4...**

---

### **3. Both Types Together**

A requirement can have BOTH:
- **Section comment** (from its parent section header)
- **Individual requirement comment** (specific to it)

```
====================================================================
📂 SECTION 5.4: COATING EQUIPMENT
====================================================================

🔖 SECTION COMMENT:
   📝 All equipment must be ATEX Zone 2 certified
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[5.4.1] Coating drum capacity should be 250L

   💬 REQUIREMENT COMMENT:
      📝 GLATT offers GCSi 250 coater with 188kg capacity
```

✅ **Requirement 5.4.1 shows BOTH:**
- Section comment (ATEX certification - applies to whole section)
- Its own specific comment (GLATT capacity details)

## 📝 Real Examples from Your Documents

### Example 1: Individual Comment Only

```
[#13] Charging tablets in coater using split butterfly valve through 
      auto charging method which shall be similar to existing design.

   💬 REQUIREMENT COMMENT:
      Author: Khatib, Mohammed
      
      📝 Glatt will be offering closed charging of the tablets into 
          the coater machine with the help of integrated closed 
          butterfly valve
```

### Example 2: Another Individual Comment

```
[#26] CIP unit should be able to supply Portable Water (Hot and Ambient),
      Purified Water, and Cleaning Solution with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.

   💬 REQUIREMENT COMMENT:
      Author: Khatib, Mohammed
      
      📝 GLATT will be offering its highly efficient WIP (Wet in place)
          system. Duct cleaning arrangement has been offered as an option.
```

### Example 3: ATEX Requirement with Long Comment

```
[#9] ATEX certified flame proof declaration should be provided where 
     flame proof design is considered in manufacturing equipment.

   💬 REQUIREMENT COMMENT:
      Author: Khatib, Mohammed [2]
      
      📝 Machine in Solvent-EX-design. Safety concept for dusts and 
          their hybrid mixtures: The machine is applicable for the use 
          of hybrid mixtures. It is designed for the placement in 
          EX-hazardous areas (zone 2). The hybrid mixtures may consist 
          of the following media:
          - Solvents: Methanol, Ethanol, Isopropanol.
          
          NOTE: If other hybrid mixtures are used as listed, this has 
          to be discussed with Glatt. The minimum ignition energy of 
          the dusty tablet material may not be lower than 3 mJ.
          
          Suggested concept for the machine in Solvent-EX-design.

## 🔧 How It Works Technically

### Detection Logic:

```python
# 1. Is this a SECTION HEADER?
pattern = r'^(\d+(\.\d+)*)\s+([A-Z\s/\-&]+)$'

Examples that match:
✅ "5.4 COATING EQUIPMENT"
✅ "8.2 SAFETY & COMPLIANCE"
✅ "10.1.2 CLEANING/MAINTENANCE"

# 2. Is this a REQUIREMENT?
- Has section number (5.4.2.13)
- Contains requirement keywords (shall, must, should, required)
- Longer than 15 characters
- Not a table header

# 3. Comment Mapping:
- If comment on section header → Store in section_comments dict
- If comment on requirement → Store in requirement's comment field
- When displaying requirements → Check both sources
```

### Comment Inheritance:

```python
# Requirement 5.4.2.13 inherits section comment from:
- 5.4.2 (if it has a comment)
- OR 5.4 (if it has a comment)
- OR 5 (if it has a comment)

# It uses the most specific parent section's comment
```

## 🚀 How to Test Section-Level Comments

### Your current documents DON'T have section-level comments.

To test this feature:

1. **Open Word document**
2. **Find a section header** like "5.4 COATING EQUIPMENT"
3. **Add a comment to it** (right-click → New Comment)
4. **Type something** like "All equipment in this section must be ATEX certified"
5. **Save the document**
6. **Run:** `python generate_complete_comments_report.py`

Result: You'll see the comment appear at the top of section 5.4, and it will apply to ALL requirements under 5.4!

## 🎯 Summary

| Scenario | Behavior | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Comment on specific requirement | Shows ONLY for that requirement | ✅ Working (87 + 43 = 130 comments) |
| Comment on section header | Shows for ALL requirements in that section | ✅ Ready (no test data yet) |
| Both types on same requirement | Shows both separately | ✅ Ready |
| Complete comment text | No truncation, full text displayed | ✅ Working |
| Author and date preservation | Preserved and displayed | ✅ Working |

---

## 💡 What This Solves

### Before:
- Comments might be shown incorrectly
- No way to apply one comment to multiple related requirements
- Comments were truncated in output
- Hard to see which comment applies where

### After:
- ✅ **Precision**: Requirement comments show ONLY where they belong
- ✅ **Context**: Section comments apply to all relevant requirements
- ✅ **Complete**: Full comment text displayed, not truncated
- ✅ **Clear**: Easy to see section vs requirement comments
- ✅ **Accurate**: Uses Word's XML structure for perfect mapping
