## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### Before:
- ❌ Flat list of requirements without structure
- ❌ No section context or organization
- ❌ Basic page-by-page display
- ❌ Limited filtering options

### After:
- ✅ **Organized by document sections** (Introduction, Functional, Performance, etc.)
- ✅ **Section-based filtering and analysis**
- ✅ **Rich metadata display** with comments and context
- ✅ **Professional requirement IDs** with section prefixes
- ✅ **Interactive section selection** for detailed analysis
- ✅ **Enhanced download options** with section-based filtering

## 📋 **Example UI Flow**

1. **Upload Document** → Shows "Document organized into 4 sections with 88 total requirements"

2. **Structure Overview** → Expandable section showing:
   ```
   Introduction: 78 requirements (14 comments)
   Functional Requirements: 4 requirements (0 comments)
   Performance Requirements: 3 requirements (4 comments)
   Operational Requirements: 3 requirements (8 comments)
   ```

3. **Section Processing** → Each section displayed separately:
   ```
   📂 Performance Requirements
   🔍 PerformanceRequirements-34-6 - Performance Requirements
   ```

4. **Analysis Summary** → Section-wise match statistics:
   ```
   Section | Total Requirements | Found in Historical | Match Rate | Avg Score
   Performance Requirements | 3 | 2 | 66.7% | 0.85
   ```

5. **Filtering** → Select specific sections for detailed analysis

## 🚀 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Better Navigation**: Users can focus on specific requirement types
2. **Professional Structure**: Mirrors actual URS document organization
3. **Enhanced Search**: Section-based filtering improves relevance
4. **Clearer Context**: Each requirement shows its document section
5. **Improved Analysis**: Section-wise statistics provide better insights

This transforms the system from a basic requirement matcher to a professional, structured URS analysis platform! 🎯
